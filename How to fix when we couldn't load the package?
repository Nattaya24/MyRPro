| Hi! I see that you have some variables saved in your workspace. To keep things
| running smoothly, I recommend you clean up before starting swirl.

| Type ls() to see a list of the variables in your workspace. Then, type
| rm(list=ls()) to clear your workspace.

| Type swirl() when you are ready to begin.
